**Stock Price Prediction with Time Series Analysis**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using time series analysis techniques. Time series forecasting is essential in financial markets, aiding investors and traders in making informed decisions. In this project, we leverage historical stock market data of Bajaj Finance Ltd. (BAJFINANCE) to build an Auto ARIMA model for predicting the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the stock.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock market data of Bajaj Finance Ltd. (BAJFINANCE). It includes various features such as the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc. The dataset spans from a specific start date to an end date.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop an Auto ARIMA model capable of predicting the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of Bajaj Finance Ltd. based on historical stock market data.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pmdarima
- statsmodels

**Installation:**
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pmdarima statsmodels
```

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build the model, and evaluate the model's performance.
4. You can also run the source code files in the src/ directory for automation or integration with other systems.

**Contributing:**
My model Overfitted the data. Need to work on that in future. Therefore, Contributions to this project are welcome. 
If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
